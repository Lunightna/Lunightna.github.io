<h1>
  2023 SU Sophomore Caucus Endorsement
</h1>
<br>
By the Editorial Board

<br>

<br>
<body class="container">
  DYNAMIC: As the current freshman caucus Co-Presidents, Lei and Chew have gained ample experience navigating the inner workings of the SU. 
  They have cultivated relationships with the other caucuses, the SU, and the administration, and have exhibited the organizational skills necessary to run ambitious events. 
  Lei and Chew have hosted a Freshmen-Only Scavenger Hunt and the Flower Bouquet Contest, and they are in the process of organizing a Semi-Formal Dance for this June. 
  This impressive track record speaks to the ticket's efficient leadership style and is a strong predictor of similar administrative successes in the future.
<br><br>
PLATFORM: Having known each other since middle school, Lei and Chew have a great dynamic. 
With Lei’s love for STEM and Chew’s passion for the humanities, the pair complements each other very well. 
As Freshman Caucus Co-Presidents, their chemistry has proved beneficial when it comes to dividing responsibilities. 
While Lei worked extensively with the IT department and budgeting, Chew worked with the Internal department on social media projects. 
Their Instagram presence indicates their close engagement with the student body. 
With their strong partnership and connections with the current freshman class, it is clear that Lei and Chew will be approachable Co-Presidents. 
<br><br>
The Lei-Chew campaign revolves around the assortment of events and policies they intend to implement. 
For events, Lei and Chew plan to hold an Egg Scavenger Hunt, speaker events, and friendly competitions for their class, including Family Feud and a Squid Game remake.
In terms of policies, Lei and Chew hope to bolster their social media influence with interactive reels, add charging stations to the school, and decorate the Sophomore Bar for special events. 
Lei and Chew also plan to continue their Freshman Caucus policies of monthly e-mails and magazines, information guides for studying and course selections, and Caucus website.
<br><br>
OVERALL REVIEW:
The Lei-Chew ticket promises another year of engaging events and practical policies aimed at alleviating sophomore stress. 
Their success in pursuing initiatives—such as the addition of shower hooks to the pool locker rooms—gives credence to the ideas they put forth. 
Their demonstrated dedication to the freshman class not only benefits the Class of 2026 but also serves the Stuyvesant community as a whole. 
<br><br>
The ticket's platform offers both practical and creative solutions to problems faced by the current freshman class. 
To promote early involvement in different fields, Lei and Chew plan to create a cabinet position solely dedicated to surfing through Mr. Blumm's Opportunities Bulletin and compiling the jobs and internships applicable to sophomores. 
One of their more ambitious policies aims to install charging stations within the Stuyvesant building—an attempt to address the dearth of outlets available for student use. 
Chew and Lei are cognizant of the considerable cost that comes with such an initiative but have developed funding strategies such as an entry fee for their freshman Semi-Formal.
They have also grown familiar with some of the stringent DOE policies on bake sales and cited other possible methods of fundraising, such as merch sales and a sophomore bar pop-up cafe, though that may not be very feasible.
<br><br>
While Lei and Chew are strong candidates for the Sophomore Caucus Co-Presidency, their ticket does not have many original, ground-breaking ideas, and their more ambitious ideas are not as feasible. 
Their AP study guides, for example, fall on the practical spectrum of ideas but are not a unique initiative. 
They acknowledge the costs of their charging station policy, but other logistical and administrative barriers of this initiative are vague.  
<br><br>
The Lei-Chew ticket has exhibited maturity in their ability to adapt to the needs of the student body. 
Their Freshman Caucus campaign promised the introduction of 8th- and 9th- floor freshman offices, but upon closer assessment, Lei and Chew realized the intrusive effects of this policy and chose not to pursue it. 
This demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the Stuyvesant community that will aid them in future initiatives should they win their class's vote. 
Thus, <i>The Spectator</i> endorses this ticket.
